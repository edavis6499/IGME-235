<p>To create the project 2 page, I used the GiphyFinder as a base but changed all the javascript from a gif finder to a pokemon search tool.</p>
<p>I figured out how to use the PokeApi through an online tutorial that demonstrated creating the Kanto region pokedex.</p>
<p>The tutorial mainly was a template for displaying the pokemon's information, since I wasn't familiar with PokeApi, their's was a static list as a demonstrating which I used to learn how to use PokeApi to make my search app to display information and to sort pokemon by type or ability.</p>

<p>For the webpage design I went with the basic red white and black color scheme of a pokeball since the app is a database of pokemon I figured using something similar to the container of pokemon would be appropriate.</p>
